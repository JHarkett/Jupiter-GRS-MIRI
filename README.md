## Contents

**figures**
Quick-look plots and figures used for Harkett et al. (2024) generated for the JWST/MIRI data and resulting atmospheric retrievals.

**data**
Contains both the raw JWST/MIRI data and the atmospheric retrieval results, there are two epochs of data; July and August. For each epoch there are three sets of observations (tiles); East, Centre and West (Note July does not contain west data). A 3-stage NEMESIS atmospheric retrieval process was used containing; stage 1, stage 2 and stage 2 Auxiliary (AUX).
/[epoch]/[tile]/ is the location of the raw data
/[epoch]/[tile]/retrieval_data/ is the location of the retrieval results for each tile
/[epoch]/mosaics_stage[number]/ is the location of the combined retrieval maps of temperature, ammonia, phosphine and aerosol distributions. [number] is either 1, 2 or 2_aux
